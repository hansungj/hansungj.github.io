# Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Hello! My name is Sungjun Han. I am an aspring scientist interested in studying how machines can make better representations of the world with minimal inductive bias. I am most interested in language processing in intersection with other machine learning topics including meta-learning, out-of-domain generalization, compositional generalization and continual learning.  

I received my Bachelor's in Engineering Science - Math, Stats, and Finance option at the University of Toronto in 2020. I worked with Prof. [Yuri Lawryshyn](https://www.labs.chem-eng.utoronto.ca/lawryshyn/) under [CMTE](https://www.cmte.utoronto.ca) for my Bachelor's thesis. Then I received my Master's degree in Computational Linguistics in 2023 working with Prof. [Sebastian Pado](https://nlpado.de/~sebastian/) under the [Institute of Natural Language Processing](https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/en/institute/) at the University of Stuttgart. 

Outside of school, I like to spend my time practicing jiu-jitsu or reading.
